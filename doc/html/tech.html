NAME="POSTFIX">2.1. The Postfix MTA</H2
><P
>	Quoting <A
HREF="http://www.postfix.org"
TARGET="_top"
>www.postfix.org</A
>
	»Postfix attempts to be fast, easy to administer, and secure, while at the same time 
	being sendmail compatible enough to not upset existing users. Thus, the outside has a 
	sendmail-ish flavor, but the inside is completely different.«

>Doesn't it look impressive? - It looks much more complicated as it is. Postfix is indeed nice
	      to configure and handle</P
><P
>Unlike sendmail, postfix is not one monolithic program, it is a compilation of small programs, each of
	      it has a specialized function. At this place I don't what to go into details with program does what.

NAME="CYRUS">2.2. Cyrus IMAP</H2
><P
>The Cyrus IMAP is developed and maintained by Carnegie Mellon University.</P
><P
>Unlike the WU-IMAPd Cyrus is using its own method to store the users mail. The data is stored 
	in a database, this makes Cyrus so performant. Especially with lots of users and/or lot of big emails, 
	there is nothing such fast as the Cyrus IMAP-server.</P
><P
>	Another very important feature is, you don't need a local Un*x user for each account. All users are 
	authenticated by the IMAP-Server. This makes it a great solution for really huge base of users.</P
><P
>	User administration is done by special IMAP-commands. This allows you to either use the commandline interface, 
	or use one of the available Webinterfaces. This Method is much more secure than a Webinterface to
	<TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
> /etc/passwd</TT
> !</P
><P
>Starting from Cyrus 2.1, the SASL-lib version 2 is used for authentication. 
	So for the setup described in this HOWTO there is a tree-layer authentication implemented. Cyrus 
	authenticates with saslauthdaemon which forwards the request
	to pam_mysql which finally looks up the MySQL-table.</P
><P
>	Since CMU changed the license policy for Cyrus, this software is going to be used by much more users</P

NAME="MYSQL">2.3. MySQL Database</H2
><P
>MySQL is a very fast, powerful and very nice to handle Database.</P
><P
>Since Cyrus can authenticate its users with pam, you can use pam_mysql as a connector to the
	Userdatebase stored in MySQL. This allows you to create a nice Webinterface for your users for changing 
	passwords, define and delete aliases and more.</P

NAME="PAM-MYSQL">2.4. pam_mysql</H2
><P
>pam means "Pluggable authentication module" and was originally proposed by some people at Sun.
	In meantime a lot of modules have been developed. One of them is an interface to MySQL</P
><P
>With pam_mysql you to store the users password in a mysql database. Further, Postfix is able to
	lookup aliases from a MySQL-table. At the end of the day, you have a base for all administrative tasks
	to be done by the Sysadmin.</P
><P
>Further you will be able to delegate some tasks to Powerusers, e.g. creating Accounts for a particular
	Domain. Changing passwords and creating new aliases can be delegated to the user. At the end of the day 
	you as a Sysadmin have the time to do some more productive tasks, or write a HOWTO for the Linux 
	Documentation Project :-)</P
