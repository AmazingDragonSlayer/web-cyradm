1. Install a Webserver (Apache or other with php4 support) with enabled socket-connetions

2. Install your mailing system according to 
   http://www.delouw.ch/linux/Postfix-Cyrus-MySQL-replex-HOWTO/html/index.html

   Its a draft of a LDP-HOWTO that describes how to set up postfix, the Cyrus IMAPd
   and using MySQL as storage for username, password and aliases.

3. The population of the Database described in that document is for replex, but its
   (not fully) compatible with web-cyradm.

   To get web-cyradm working you have to add a new field to the table "domain"
   You can do that with the following SQL-query:

   ALTER TABLE `mail`.`domain` ADD `quota` INT DEFAULT '20000' NOT NULL; 

4. Untar the package where you want to have web-cyradm. A good place would be
   /usr/local/apache/htdocs/web-cyradm

   mv web-cyradm-cvs-2002-03-30.tar.gz /usr/local/apache/htdocs/
   tar -xvzf web-cyradm-cvs-2002-03-30.tar.gz

5. Protect the web-cyradm with Basic Authentication

   edit your httpd.conf and add:

   <Directory /usr/local/apache/htdocs/web-cyradm>
   AuthType Basic
   AuthName "Cyrus Admin"
   AuthUserfile /usr/local/apache/cyrus
   <Limit GET POST>
   require valid-user
   </limit>
   </Directory>

   Add a valid user by doing:
  
   /usr/local/apache/bin/htpasswd -c /usr/local/apache/cyrus admin

   Restart apache:

   /usr/local/apache/bin/apachectl restart

6. Edit and install web-cyadm/config.inc.php-dist

   cp config.inc.php-dist config.inc.php

   Edit the values of the Variables found there


Thats basically all, let me know if I forgot something....
