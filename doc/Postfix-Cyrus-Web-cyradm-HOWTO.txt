1. Introduction

The cyrus part is only valid for Cyrus-IMAP 2.1.x and Cyrus-SASL 2.1.x. If
you plan to use Cyrus-IMAP 2.0.x then please consult the depricated version
1.0.x of this HOWTO.

I recommand stronly to update to the Cyrus Version 2.1.x. If you do so, you
will have chances to get valuable support by the community

     _________________________________________________________________

1.2. Why I wrote this document

There are different approaches howto set up different mailsystems. Most
documents available are related to Sendmail, procmail, WU-IMAPd and friends.
These fine-running software is unfortunately very un-flexible concerning
user administration.

For longer time I was testing alternative MTA's like qmail, postfix and
exim, IMAP/POP-servers like Cyrus, vpopmail, Courier IMAP and others.

At the end of the day, from my point of view the couple Postfix/Cyrus seems
to be the most flexible and performant solution.

All these combinations of software had one in common: there was only little
documentation available concerning how this software is working together
with each other. For installing the software, lot of effort must be spent to
get all information needed to get all software running.

2. Technologies

2.1. The Postfix MTA

Quoting [63]www.postfix.org »Postfix attempts to be fast, easy to
administer, and secure, while at the same time being sendmail compatible
enough to not upset existing users. Thus, the outside has a sendmail-ish
flavor, but the inside is completely different.«

   Figure 1. Postfix - the big picture

   [big-picture.png]

   Doesn't it look impressive? - It looks much more complicated as it is.
   Postfix is indeed nice to configure and handle

   Unlike sendmail, postfix is not one monolithic program, it is a
   compilation of small programs, each of it has a specialized function.
   At this place I don't what to go into details with program does what.
   If you are interested how Postfix is working, please see the
   documentation at [64]http://www.postfix.org/docs.html

   In this document you will find the information what to put in the
   config files
     _________________________________________________________________

2.2. Cyrus IMAP

The Cyrus IMAP is developed and maintained by Carnegie Mellon University.

Unlike the WU-IMAPd Cyrus is using its own method to store the users mail.
The data is stored in a database, this makes Cyrus so performant. Especially
with lots of users and/or lot of big emails, there is nothing such fast as
the Cyrus IMAP-server.

Another very important feature is, you don't need a local Un*x user for each
account. All users are authenticated by the IMAP-Server. This makes it a
great solution for really huge base of users.

User administration is done by special IMAP-commands. This allows you to
either use the commandline interface, or use one of the available
Webinterfaces. This Method is much more secure than a Webinterface to
/etc/passwd !

Starting from Cyrus 2.1, the SASL-lib version 2 is used for authentication.
So for the setup described in this HOWTO there is a tree-layer
authentication implemented. Cyrus authenticates with saslauthdaemon which
forwards the request to pam_mysql which finally looks up the MySQL-table.

Since CMU changed the license policy for Cyrus, this software is going to be
used by much more users
     _________________________________________________________________

2.3. MySQL Database

MySQL is a very fast, powerful and very nice to handle Database.

Since Cyrus can authenticate its users with pam, you can use pam_mysql as a
connector to the Userdatebase stored in MySQL. This allows you to create a
nice Webinterface for your users for changing passwords, define and delete
aliases and more.
     _________________________________________________________________

2.4. pam_mysql

pam means "Pluggable authentication module" and was originally proposed by
some people at Sun. In meantime a lot of modules have been developed. One of
them is an interface to MySQL

With pam_mysql you to store the users password in a mysql database. Further,
Postfix is able to lookup aliases from a MySQL-table. At the end of the day,
you have a base for all administrative tasks to be done by the Sysadmin.

Further you will be able to delegate some tasks to Powerusers, e.g. creating
Accounts for a particular Domain. Changing passwords and creating new
aliases can be delegated to the user. At the end of the day you as a
Sysadmin have the time to do some more productive tasks, or write a HOWTO
for the Linux Documentation Project :-)
     _________________________________________________________________

2.5. Web-cyradm Webinterface

   Figure 2. Web-cyradm Domain administration

   [home.png]

   Web-cyradm is the Webinterface that allows you to perform the
   administrative tasks to your mailsystem This Screenshot shows the
   domain-administration part of Web-cyradm.

   Web-cyradm is written in PHP, which is often installed on webservers.
   Time to set up Web-cyradm takes just a few minutes.

   Features:

     * Administration of multiple virtual domains
     * Setting of quotas
     * Automatically create username, eigher with a defined prefix, or
       the domainame as postfix
     * Delegate tasks like creating new users to »Domain Masters«
     * Map useraccounts to emailadresses

   At the time being, Web-cyradm does only have experimental support for
   different roles of its users. If you plan to use is as a frontend for
   your powerusers, please notice, that security may be a problem, the
   rolebased stuff needs a security rewiev.
     _________________________________________________________________

3. Getting and installing the software

Most of the software is included in your Linux distribution. SuSE is
shipping Cyrus as far as I know since 7.1. Since SuSE 8.1, cyrus-imap 2.1
and sasl2 is included, but not yet tested for this setup. Redhat does not
ship any cyrus software (7.3).
     _________________________________________________________________

3.1. Getting and installing MySQL

3.1.1. Download

Origin-Site: [65]http://www.mysql.com/downloads/
     _________________________________________________________________

3.1.2. Building and installing

cd /usr/local
tar -xvzf mysql-3.23.51.tar.gz
cd mysql-3.23.51

./configure \
--prefix=/usr/local/mysql \
--enable-assembler \
--with-innodb

make
make install

/usr/local/mysql/bin/mysql_install_db
echo /usr/local/mysql/lib/mysql >> /etc/ld.so.conf
ldconfig

ln -s /usr/local/mysql/include/mysql /usr/include/mysql
ln -s /usr/local/mysql/lib/mysql /usr/lib/mysql

   For security-improvement add a mysql-user on your system i.e. "mysql",
   then
   chown -R mysql /usr/local/mysql/var

   and change the line user=root to user=mysql in the file
   /usr/local/mysql/bin/safe_mysqld

   you may wish to start mysql automatically at boottime, copy
   /usr/local/mysql/share/mysql/mysql.server to /etc/init.d/ for SuSE,
   for Redhat it is /etc/rc.d/init.d instead of /etc/init.d/. Further you
   need to add Symlinks to /etc/init.d/rc3.d for SuSE and /etc/rc.d/rc3.d

   The following example is for SuSE Linux and should be easily changed
   for Redhat and other Linux distributions and commercial Unixes.
cp /usr/local/mysql/share/mysql/mysql.server /etc/init.d/
ln -s /etc/init.d/mysql.server /etc/init.d/rc3.d/S20mysql
ln -s /etc/init.d/mysql.server /etc/init.d/rc3.d/k08mysql
     _________________________________________________________________

3.2. Getting and installing Berkely DB

The Berkely DB is a requirement for building Cyrus-SASL and Cyrus-IMAP. Some
Systems comes with recent versions but without the header files installed.
Please see your distributors CD/DVD to check if you can install the
headerfiles from a package.

The version that comes with GNU/Debian Linux is out of Date, you will need
to compile most recent version instead. If you allready installed Berkely DB
on your Debian Box, please fist uninstall the software to prevent conflicts.

It is also very important, that Cyrus-SASL and Cyrus-IMAP ist compiled with
the same version of Berkely DB of else you can run into problems
     _________________________________________________________________

3.2.1. Download Berkely DB

Origin-Site: [66]http://www.sleepycat.com/update/snapshot/db-4.0.14.tar.gz
     _________________________________________________________________

3.2.2. Builing and installing Berkeley DB

cd dist

./configure --prefix=/usr/local/bdb

make
make install

echo /usr/local/bdb/lib >> /etc/ld.so.conf

ldconfig
     _________________________________________________________________

3.3. Getting and installing Cyrus SASL and IMAP

Building Cyrus SASL and IMAP from source is not a easy task. There are some
prerequisites to be fulfilled, and lots of difficult authentication related
stuff to be considered.
     _________________________________________________________________

3.3.1. Download Cyrus SASL and Cyrus IMAP

Origin-Site:
[67]ftp://ftp.andrew.cmu.edu/pub/cyrus-mail/cyrus-sasl-2.1.9.tar.gz

Origin-Site:
[68]ftp://ftp.andrew.cmu.edu/pub/cyrus-mail/cyrus-imapd-2.1.9.tar.gz
     _________________________________________________________________

3.3.2. Building and installing Cyrus SASL

tar -xvzf cyrus-sasl-2.1.9.tar.gz
cd cyrus-sasl-2.1.9

./configure \
--enable-anon \
--enable-plain \
--enable-login \
--disable-krb4 \
--with-saslauthd=/var/run/saslauthd \
--with-pam \
--with-dblib=berkeley \
--with-bdb-libdir=/usr/local/bdb/lib \
--with-bdb-incdir=/usr/local/bdb/inlude \
--with-openssl-dir=/usr/local/ssl \
--with-plugindir=/usr/local/lib/sasl2


make
make install

mkdir -p /var/run/saslauthd

cd saslauthd
make testsaslauthd
cp testsaslauthd /usr/local/bin

ldconfig

   The SASL library is installed in /usr/local/lib/sasl2 but some
   programs are expecting SASL in /usr/lib/sasl2. So it is a good idea to
   create a symlink: ln -s /usr/local/lib/sasl2 /usr/lib/sasl2.

   The testsaslauthd program allows you to test the saslauthd,
   description follows later.
     _________________________________________________________________

3.3.3. Building Cyrus-IMAP

tar -xvzf cyrus-imapd-2.1.9.tar.gz
cd cyrus-imapd-2.1.9

export CPPFLAGS="-I/usr/include/et"

./configure \
--with-sasl=/usr/local/lib \
--with-perl \
--with-auth=unix \
--with-openssl=/usr/local/ssl \
--without-ucdsnmp

make depend
make
make install
     _________________________________________________________________

3.3.4. Automatic startup script

If you wish to start the Cyrus IMAP daemon automatically after booting, you
need a startupscript. Place the following script in /etc/init.d/ for Redhat
it is /etc/rc.d/init.d instead of /etc/init.d/.

#!/bin/bash
#
# Cyrus startup script

case "$1" in
    start)
        # Starting SASL saslauthdaemon
        /usr/local/sbin/saslauthd -a pam&

        # Starting Cyrus IMAP Server
        /usr/cyrus/bin/master &
        ;;

    stop)

        # Stopping SASL saslauthdaemon
        killall saslauthd

        # Stopping Cyrus IMAP Server
        killall /usr/cyrus/bin/master

        ;;

    *)
        echo "Usage: $0 {start|stop}"
        exit 1
        ;;

esac

   If I get the time, I'll provide a more sophisticated script, but this
   script works

   Now create the Symlinks in the runlevel directory (SuSE):
ln -s /etc/init.d/cyrus /etc/init.d/rc3.d/S20
ln -s /etc/init.d/cyrus /etc/init.d/rc3.d/K10

   For Redhat:
ln -s /etc/rc.d/init.d/cyrus /etc/rc.d/rc3.d/S20cyrus
ln -s /etc/rc.d/init.d/cyrus /etc/rc.d/rc3.d/K10cyrus

   Attn the distributors: W H E N will all distributors use the same
   paths for the init script? thanks!
     _________________________________________________________________

3.4. Getting and installing Postfix

3.4.1. Download

Origin-Site: [69]http://www.postfix.org/ftp-sites.html

If you want to use SMTP authentication, you need to download the latest
snapshot release, version 1.1.11 does NOT work with sasl2. Use
1.1.11-20020928 or newer.
     _________________________________________________________________

3.4.2. Creating a User-ID (UID) and Group-ID (GID) for postfix

Before you can build and install postfix you have to be sure a »postfix« and
a »postdrop« groups and users exists on the System. First check for the
groups. You can check this by grep postfix /etc/group and grep maildrop
/etc/group

If there are no such groups and users, you just create them. Search for a
free nummeric UID and GID. In the following example I will use UID and GID
33333 for Postfix and 33335 for the maildrop UID and GID. This ID's are
corresponding to other documents.

groupadd -g 33333 postfix
groupadd -g 33335 postdrop

useradd -u 33333 -g 33333 -d /dev/null -s /bin/false postfix
     _________________________________________________________________

3.4.3. Building and installing

The following screen shows what you have to do, if you installed MySQL from
source as described above. If you installed MySQL from a binary package such
as rpm or deb, then you have to change the include and library-flags to
-I/usr/include/mysql and -L/usr/lib/mysql.

tar -xvzf postfix-1.1.11-20020928.tar.gz

cd postfix-1.1.11-20020928

make makefiles 'CCARGS=-DHAS_MYSQL \
-I/usr/local/mysql/include/mysql -DUSE_SASL_AUTH \
-I/usr/local/include/sasl' 'AUXLIBS=-L/usr/local/mysql/lib/mysql \
-lmysqlclient -lz -lm -L/usr/local/lib -lsasl2'

make install

   During make install a few question are asked. Just pressing Enter
   should match your needs. For Redhat users it could be useful to enter
   /usr/local/share/man
     _________________________________________________________________

3.5. Getting and installing pam_mysql

3.5.1. Download

Origin-Site: [70]http://sourceforge.net/projects/pam-mysql/
     _________________________________________________________________

3.5.2. Installing

If you compiled MySQL by yourself, you need to create a symlink to the MySQL
includes and libraries

Additionally there is a bug in the Makefile which you need to correct. Edit
the file and replace as follow:

old:

export LD_D=gcc -shared -Xlinker -x -L/usr/lib/mysql

new:

export LD_D=gcc -shared -Xlinker -x -L/usr/lib/mysql -lz

   After customizing that file go ahead with compiling pam_mysql
tar -xvzf pam_mysql-0.4.7.tar.gz

cd pam_mysql

make

cp pam_mysql.so /lib/security

ln -s /tmp/mysql.sock /var/lib/mysql/mysql.sock
     _________________________________________________________________

3.6. Getting and installing Web-cyradm

3.6.1. Download

Origin-Site: [71]http://www.web-cyradm.org
     _________________________________________________________________

3.6.2. Installing

Web-cyradm is written in PHP. If you don't have a webserver with php
installed, I like to refer to my [72]Apache-Compile-HOWTO. That document
describes how to set up Apache with PHP and other modules

I M P O R T A N T : Since web-cyradm is under heavy development, it maybe
does not work properly with PHP 4.2.1 or newer. Please edit your
/usr/local/lib/php.ini and set »register_globals=On« to be sure it works.
please report any bugs to web-cyradm@test.delouw.ch (after subscribing the
list).

Since web-cyradm uses PEAR for its database abstraction, you will also need
a recent copy of PEAR. This is included in recent PHP Versions. I strongly
suggest to update PHP anyway to 4.2.3 because a lot of important bugs have
been fixed.

An often error done is to forget to touch the logfile and change the owner
to the UID that Apache use. This is usually »nobody« or »wwwrun«.

cd /usr/local/apache/htdocs

tar -xvzf web-cyradm-0.5.2.tar.gz

touch /var/log/web-cyradm.log
chown nobody /var/log/web-cyradm.log

   After unpacking web-cyradm move it to a place in your webservers
   DocumentRoot

   This is all, now we need to configure the whole bunch of software
     _________________________________________________________________

4. Configuring MySQL

4.1. Securing MySQL

Because you are using MySQL to authenticate users, you need to restrict
network access to Port 3306.

I suggest to just bind mysql to the loopback-interface 127.0.0.1. This makes
sure nobody can connect to your MySQL-Daemon via the network.

edit /etc/init.d/mysql.server and edit line 107 as following:

Original line:

$bindir/safe_mysqld --datadir=$datadir --pid-file=$pid_file&

   Changed line:
$bindir/safe_mysqld --datadir=$datadir --pid-file=$pid_file \
--bind-address=127.0.0.1&

   (Re-)start your MySQL-Daemon by issuing /etc/init.d/mysql.server start

   To ensure the configuration-change was successful issue: netstat
   -an|grep LISTEN. The Output should be looking similar to this:
bond:~ # netstat -an|grep LISTEN
tcp        0      0 127.0.0.1:3306          0.0.0.0:*               LISTEN
     _________________________________________________________________

4.2. Create the databases and tables

Now we need to create the database and tables for postfix and web-cyradm and
add a user to the database

Web-cyradm comes with two SQL-files: insertuser.sql and create.sql The first
inserts the Database user to the database »mysql«, the second creates the
database »mail« and the needed tables.

The password for the user "mail" in this example is "secret" please insert
whatever user and password you like

First you must add the user by executing /usr/local/mysql/bin/mysql <
insertuser.sql After the new DB-user is successfully added, you need to
reload mysql with mysqladmin reload

To create the needed tables in the database:

/usr/local/mysql/bin/mysql mail -u mail -p < \
/usr/local/apache/htdocs/web-cyradm/scripts/create.sql

   Now lets populate our tables, and insert the first admin-user. This
   user is needed to login to Web-cyradm

   Execute /usr/local/mysql/bin/mysql mail -u mail -p And type the
   following SQL queries:
INSERT INTO adminuser (username, password) VALUES ('admin', 'test');
INSERT INTO domainadmin (domain_name,adminuser) VALUES ('*','admin');
INSERT INTO accountuser (username, password) VALUES ('cyrus', 'secret');

   The first query inserts the admin user into the database, the second
   one is needed that the cyrus user can be authenticated, use the same
   password like defined in
   /usr/local/apache/htdocs/web-cyradm/config.inc.php

   Please note, this setup for web-cyradm is fully compatible with
   replex, another project. Please see [73]http://www.replex.org for more
   details.
     _________________________________________________________________

5. Configuring PAM

Now we need to get sure that PAM knows how to authenticate the Cyrus users

You have to create the file /etc/pam.d/imap with the following entries:

auth sufficient pam_mysql.so user=mail passwd=secret host=localhost db=mail tab
le=accountuser usercolumn=username   passwdcolumn=password crypt=0

auth sufficient pam_unix_auth.so

account required pam_mysql.so user=mail passwd=secret host=localhost db=mail ta
ble=accountuser usercolumn=username passwdcolumn=password   crypt=0

account  sufficient       pam_unix_acct.so

   The lines containing pam_unix_auth.so and pam_unix_acct.so are only
   needed if you are migrating from wu-IMAP to cyrus. This way the users
   can be authenticate with its old unix-password and its new mysql-based
   password

   If you will use Cyrus also for POP-Service just cp /etc/pam.d/imap
   /etc/pam.d/pop For user that like to use also sieve, must also make a
   pam module for the sieve service with the following entry: cp
   /etc/pam.d/imap /etc/pam.d/sieve Finally if you want to use SMTP
   authentication you need to copy the same file: cp /etc/pam.d/imap
   /etc/pam.d/smtp
cp /etc/pam.d/imap /etc/pam.d/pop
cp /etc/pam.d/imap /etc/pam.d/sieve
cp /etc/pam.d/imap /etc/pam.d/smtp
     _________________________________________________________________

6. Configuring Postfix

Postfix needs two major config files: main.cf and master.cf. Both needs now
our attention.
     _________________________________________________________________

6.1. master.cf

You need to change just one line:

old:

flags=R user=cyrus argv=/cyrus/bin/deliver -e -m ${extension} ${user}

   new:
flags= user=cyrus argv=/usr/cyrus/bin/deliver -r ${sender} -m ${extension} ${us
er}

   What affect that changes?

   A look to the cyrus man-pages man deliverclears that issue:

   The Postfix default setup uses a wrong path to the cyrus deliver, this
   is the first change. The parameter »-r« Inserts a proper return path,
   without that mail rejected by sieve will be sent to cyrus at
   yourdomain.
     _________________________________________________________________

6.2. main.cf

Here you need to change some more things like hostname, relaying,
alias-lookups etc.

First change hostname:

myhostname = foo.bar.org

   mydestination

   Here you have to put all domainnames that are local (corresponding to
   sendmail's /etc/mail/sendmail.cw) If you have multiple domains
   separate them with comma
mydestination = foo.bar.org, example.com, furchbar-grausam.ch,
 whatever.domain.tld, mysql:/etc/postfix/mysql-mydestination.cf

   relayhost

   Here you define where to deliver outgoing mails. If you do not provide
   any host. mails are delivered directly to the destination smtp host.
   Usually your relayhosts are your providers smtp-server
   relayhost = relay01.foobar.net relay02.foobar.net relay03.foobar.net

   mailtransport

   Here you define how the mails accepted for local delivery should be
   handled. In our situation mails should be delivered by the cyrus
   delivery-program
   mailbox_transport = cyrus

   At the end of file you need to add:
  virtual_maps = hash:/etc/postfix/virtual, mysql:/etc/postfix/mysql-virtual.cf

   Outgoing addresses should be rewritten from i.e test0002 at domain to
   user.name at virtualhost.com. This is important if you like to use a
   webmail interface.
   sender_canonical_maps = mysql:/etc/postfix/mysql-canonical.cf

   Now you need to create the file /etc/postfix/mysql-virtual.cf:
#
# mysql config file for alias lookups on postfix
# comments are ok.
#

# the user name and password to log into the mysql server
hosts = localhost
user = mail
password = secret

# the database name on the servers
dbname = mail

# the table name
table = virtual

#
select_field = dest
where_field = alias
additional_conditions = and status = '1'

   The file /etc/postfix/mysql-canonical.cf:
# mysql config file for canonical lookups on postfix
# comments are ok.
#

# the user name and password to log into the mysql server
hosts = localhost
user = mail
password = secret

# the database name on the servers
dbname = mail

# the table name
table = virtual
#
select_field = alias
where_field = username
# Return the first match only
additional_conditions = and status = '1' limit 1

   Finally the file /etc/postfix/mysql-mydestination.cf:
# mysql config file for local domain (like sendmail's sendmail.cw) lookups on p
ostfix
# comments are ok.
#

# the user name and password to log into the mysql server
hosts = localhost
user = mail
password = secret

# the database name on the servers
dbname = mail

# the table name
table = domain
#
select_field = domain_name
where_field = domain_name

   SMTP Authentication with SASL and PAM

   Put the following in your /etc/postfix/main.cf
smtpd_sasl_auth_enable = yes
smtpd_recipient_restrictions = permit_sasl_authenticated, check_relay_domains
smtpd_sasl_security_options = noanonymous
broken_sasl_auth_clients = yes

   You also need to create the file /usr/local/lib/sasl2/smtpd.conf with
   the following content:
   pwcheck_method: saslauthd

   The next step is make the saslauthd socket being found by postfix:
mv /var/run/sasl2 /var/run/sasl2-old
ln -s /var/run/saslauthd /var/run/sasl2
     _________________________________________________________________

7. Configuring Cyrus IMAP

7.1. Creating the config files

You have to create /etc/imapd.conf and /etc/cyrus.conf
     _________________________________________________________________

7.1.1. /etc/services

If you like to use sieve (A Mail Filtering Language), you must change an
entry in /etc/services. With SuSE 8.0 take especiall care about the port for
sieve, they defined the wrong port. Add or change the following line:

pop3            110/tcp
imap            143/tcp
imaps           993/tcp
pop3s           995/tcp
sieve           2000/tcp
     _________________________________________________________________

7.1.2. /etc/imapd.conf

postmaster: postmaster
configdirectory: /var/imap
partition-default: /var/spool/imap
admins: cyrus
allowanonymouslogin: no
allowplaintext: yes
sasl_mech_list: PLAIN
servername: servername
autocreatequota: 10000
reject8bit: no
quotawarn: 90
timeout: 30
poptimeout: 10
dracinterval: 0
drachost: localhost
sasl_pwcheck_method: saslauthd
sievedir: /usr/sieve
sendmail: /usr/sbin/sendmail
sieve_maxscriptsize: 32
sieve_maxscripts: 5
#unixhierarchysep: yes

   Be sure »servername« contains your FQHN (Fully qualified hostname)

   The parameter »unixhierarchysep: yes« is only used if you like to have
   usernames like »hans.mueller.somedomain.tld« see [74]Section 8 for
   more info
     _________________________________________________________________

7.1.3. Creating the TLS/SSL Certificate

If you want to enable Cyrus' TLS/SSL facilities you have to create a
certificate first. This requires an OpenSSL installation

openssl req -new -nodes -out req.pem -keyout key.pem
openssl rsa -in key.pem -out new.key.pem
openssl x509 -in req.pem -out ca-cert -req \
-signkey new.key.pem -days 999

mkdir /var/imap

cp new.key.pem /var/imap/server.pem
rm new.key.pem
cat ca-cert >> /var/imap/server.pem

chown cyrus:mail /var/imap/server.pem
chmod 600 /var/imap/server.pem # Your key should be protected

echo tls_ca_file: /var/imap/server.pem >> /etc/imapd.conf
echo tls_cert_file: /var/imap/server.pem >> /etc/imapd.conf
echo tls_key_file: /var/imap/server.pem >> /etc/imapd.conf
     _________________________________________________________________

7.1.4. /etc/cyrus.conf

The other file you need to create is /etc/cyrus.conf It is the configuration
file for the Cyrus master process. It defines the startup procedures,
services and events to be spawned by process »master«.

# standard standalone server implementation

START {
  # do not delete these entries!
  mboxlist      cmd="ctl_mboxlist -r"
  deliver       cmd="ctl_deliver -r"

  # this is only necessary if using idled for IMAP IDLE
#  idled                cmd="idled"
}

# UNIX sockets start with a slash and are put into /var/imap/socket
SERVICES {
  # add or remove based on preferences
  imap          cmd="imapd" listen="imap" prefork=0
  imaps         cmd="imapd -s" listen="imaps" prefork=0
  pop3          cmd="pop3d" listen="pop3" prefork=0
  pop3s         cmd="pop3d -s" listen="pop3s" prefork=0
  sieve         cmd="timsieved" listen="sieve" prefork=0

  # at least one LMTP is required for delivery
#  lmtp         cmd="lmtpd" listen="lmtp" prefork=0
  lmtpunix      cmd="lmtpd" listen="/var/imap/socket/lmtp" prefork=0
}

EVENTS {
  # this is required
  checkpoint    cmd="ctl_mboxlist -c" period=30

  # this is only necessary if using duplicate delivery suppression
  delprune      cmd="ctl_deliver -E 3" period=1440
}
     _________________________________________________________________

7.2. Creating the directories

There must be created different directories. Additionally you should change
some attributes of the filesystem
     _________________________________________________________________

7.2.1. /var/imap

cd /var
mkdir imap
chown cyrus:mail imap
chmod 750 imap
     _________________________________________________________________

7.2.2. /var/spool/imap

cd /var/spool
mkdir imap
chown cyrus:mail imap
chmod 750 imap
     _________________________________________________________________

7.2.3. /usr/sieve

cd /usr
mkdir sieve
chown cyrus:mail sieve
chmod 750 sieve
     _________________________________________________________________

7.2.4. The rest of the directories

The rest of the directories can be created by the tool mkimap

su - cyrus
/usr/local/cyrus-imapd-2.1.5/tools/mkimap
     _________________________________________________________________

7.3. Changing the attributes

cd /var/imap

chattr +S user quota user/* quota/*
chattr +S /var/spool/imap /var/spool/imap/*
     _________________________________________________________________

8. Configuring Web-cyradm

First copy the distributions config file

cp config.inc.php-dist config.inc.php

touch /var/log/web-cyradm-login.log
chown nobody /var/log/web-cyradm-login.log
     _________________________________________________________________

8.1. Cyrus setup

# The Cyrus login stuff

$CYRUS_HOST="localhost";
$CYRUS_PORT="143";
$CYRUS_USERNAME="cyrus";
$CYRUS_PASSWORD="secret";

   This should be self-explanatory. Please note there is no support for
   SSL connections at the moment, this is especially important for users
   that what to like to have web-cyradm not on the same server where the
   cyrus-imapd resides.
     _________________________________________________________________

8.2. Database setup

Please note: the database releated code is now being rewritten to use PEAR
as a database abstraction. So in future you will be able to also use
PostgreSQL as database engine (with the patch for postfix). In meantime it
is needed to setup the database setup twice (only for the CVS versions,
release 2002-05-25_xx will just ignore the unused stuff).

The MySQL stuff to be replaced after all files have PEAR implemented

$MYSQL_HOST="localhost";

   Put here the name of your mysql-server. Please note that if you use a
   mysql database on the same host as web-cyradm does, use »localhost« as
   the hostname if you followed the instructions at [75]Section 4.
$MYSQL_DB="mail";
$MYSQL_USER="mail";
$MYSQL_PASSWD="secret";

   This should be self-explanatory
/* DB_TYPE

 Possible Values are:
 o mysql
 o pgsql

 To operate a mailsystem with postgreSQL you will need a patch for
 Postfix.

 Other Databases needs to be supported by PAM and postfix

*/


$DB_TYPE="mysql";

$DB_HOST="localhost";
$DB_NAME="mail";
$DB_USER="mail";
$DB_PASSWD="secret";

   This is the PEAR stuff with is only needed (at the moment) if you work
   with the CVS versions
   $DSN="$DB_TYPE://$DB_USER:$DB_PASSWD@$DB_HOST/$DB_NAME";

   And this variable is the final result of the PEAR configuration which
   is used by web-cyradm, please leave in untouched
     _________________________________________________________________

8.3. Default Quota

The default quota to be used is set in the Variable »DEFAULT_QUOTA=20000«
and is used when creating a new domain
     _________________________________________________________________

8.4. Crypted passwords

At the moment the handling of crypted passwords is not yet supported and
will be implemented in one of the next major releases. In meantime please
leave the value of the Variable $CRYPT=0
     _________________________________________________________________

8.5. Usernames

There are two schemas of usernames supported with are defined in the
variable »DOMAIN_AS_PREFIX«. The default is to have a defined prefix
($DOMAIN_AS_PREFIX=0), i.e. »test« for the domain »expample.com«. With this
scheme, the first user gets the username test0001, the second test0002 and
incrementing.

The other one is to have usernames like »hans.mueller.example.com«. If that
case set $DOMAIN_AS_PREFIX=1

At the moment you can not mix both schemas, evaluate carefully with scheme
matches your needs best

If you choose to have $DOMAIN_AS_PREFIX=1, be sure you uncomment the option
»unixhierarchysep: yes« like described in [76]Section 7.1.2
     _________________________________________________________________

9. Testing the setup
     _________________________________________________________________

9.1. (Re-)Starting the daemons

Now all the software has been installed and configured, lets do some
testings now. First you have to (re-)start all the daemons affected

     * postfix start
     * /etc/init.d/cyrus start
     * /etc/init.d/mysql.server start
     * /usr/local/apache/bin/apachectl startssl

   Hopefully all daemons started without any complaints...

   Now you can verify if the daemons are running properly by issuing
   netstat -an|grep LISTEN

   The output should look similar like that:
bond:~ # netstat -an|grep LISTEN
tcp        0      0 0.0.0.0:993             0.0.0.0:*               LISTEN
tcp        0      0 0.0.0.0:995             0.0.0.0:*               LISTEN
tcp        0      0 127.0.0.1:3306          0.0.0.0:*               LISTEN
tcp        0      0 0.0.0.0:110             0.0.0.0:*               LISTEN
tcp        0      0 0.0.0.0:143             0.0.0.0:*               LISTEN
tcp        0      0 0.0.0.0:2000            0.0.0.0:*               LISTEN
tcp        0      0 0.0.0.0:80              0.0.0.0:*               LISTEN
tcp        0      0 0.0.0.0:25              0.0.0.0:*               LISTEN
tcp        0      0 0.0.0.0:443             0.0.0.0:*               LISTEN

   The port are assigned like this:

     * 993 imap-ssl
     * 995 pop3-ssl
     * 3306 mysql
     * 110 pop3
     * 143 imap
     * 2000 sieve
     * 80 http
     * 25 smtp
     * 443 https
     _________________________________________________________________

9.2. Testing Web-cyradm

Now you should be able to connect to [77]http://localhost/web-cyradm/ Login
with the credentials defined before.

Define a Domainname and some accounts. Be sure the domainname belongs to
your server. If not you have to fake it by enter the domain in /etc/hosts.
The Domain must also be defined as local in /etc/postfix/main.cf
(mydestination = domain)

Please be sure that you are providing a unique domainprefix when adding a
new domain. I.e. test for the domain test.org. If you dont provide such a
prefix you will get a error-message
     _________________________________________________________________

9.3. Testing postfix

Now we are going to write a mail:

telnet localhost 25
Trying ::1...
Trying 127.0.0.1...
Connected to localhost.
Escape character is '^]'.
220 mail ESMTP Postfix

helo localhost
250 mail
mail from: luc at delouw.ch
250 Ok
rcpt to: rcpt to: luc at localhost
250 Ok

data
354 End data with <CR><LF>.<CR><LF>
some text
.
250 Ok: queued as B58E141D33

quit

   If you see such a message, then all seems to work fine. Be sure to
   specify a recipients address you previously defined in the web-cyradm
   database

   If you get an error like this:
rcpt to: luc at localhost
451 <luc at localhost>: Temporary lookup failure

   Then either MySQL is not running, DB permission are not set properly
   or you miss-configured /etc/postfix/main.cf

   On any errors, I suggest to examine /var/log/mail. Often you will find
   some hints whats went wrong.
     _________________________________________________________________

9.4. Testing the IMAP and POP functionality

A lot of users like to test the cyrus-IMAPd with the Command Line Interface
(CLI) »cyradm« and they are failing. To be sucessful with cyradm, you will
need to add the cyrus user to /etc/sasldb2 because »cyradm« always
authenticates against SASL __and__ IMAP.

To add the cyrus user to the sasldb use the command:

saslpasswd2 -c cyrus
Password: (enter your passwd)
Again (for verification): (enter your password)

   To use the »cyradm« CLI please take care that the tool does not
   recognize standart CLI-options like -u and similar. Please follow the
   syntax like descibed in the man page »cyradm 1« like the following
   example:
bond:~ # cyradm --user cyrus --server localhost --auth plain
Password: # This is the SASL2 password
IMAP Password: # This is the IMAP password that you need to enter in the mysql-
table »accountusers«
localhost>

   With the cyrus command help you will see all possible commands and its
   abbreviations

   To make that kind of tests. you just need a mailclient like kmail or
   netscape (Yes of course M$-Products are working as well) but in this
   example I'll using kmail

   Figure 3. Creating a new account

   [imap-account.png]

   If you enabled TLS/SSL, you may wish to test also the following:

   Figure 4. Testing TLS/SSL functionality

   [imap-tls.png]

   If login fails, and you are sure, you typed the right password, take
   care that MySQL is running

Here you will find some other resources available in the internet
     _________________________________________________________________

10.1. News groups

Some of the most interesting news groups are:

     * [78]alt.comp.mail.postfix
       This is low traffic-group
     * [79]comp.mail.imap

   Maybe you also check out your country newsgroups e.g ch.comp.os.linux

   Most newsgroups have their own FAQ that are designed to answer most of
   your questions, as the name Frequently Asked Questions indicate. Fresh
   versions should be posted regularly to the relevant newsgroups. If you
   cannot find it in your news spool you could go directly to the [80]FAQ

10.3. HOWTO

These are intended as the primary starting points to get the background
information as well as show you how to solve a specific problem. Some
relevant HOWTOs are [91]Cyrus-IMAP and [92]Apache-Compile-HOWTO. The main
site for these is the [93]LDP archive
     _________________________________________________________________

10.4. Local Resources

Usually distributions installs some documentation to your system. As a
standard they are located in /usr/share/doc/packages

The SuSE rpms of Cyrus contains a lot a such documentation.

Postfix has some html-files in the source directory
/usr/local/postfix-1.1.11/html

PAM comes also with lots of documentation in /usr/share/doc/packages/pam

The pam_mysql module has a readme with the size of 1670 bytes :-(
     _________________________________________________________________

10.5. Web Sites

There are a huge number of informative web sites available. By their very
nature they change quickly so do not be surprised if these links become
quickly outdated.

A good starting point is of course the [94]Linux Documentation Project home
page, an information central for documentation, project pages and much more.

To get more deepened information about Postfix, then [95]www.postfix.org
would be the starting point.

Please let me know if you have any other leads that can be of interest.

11. Questions and Answers

Here I answer the questions which I got from users. If you don't find an
answer feel free to contact me

     * Q: Does web-cyradm only support users like »test0001« ? I'd like
       to have a more desciptive username
       A: web-cyradm does also support usernames like
       »user.name.example.com« if you configure it. Your need to change
       config.inc.php and change the value of DOMAIN_AS_PREFIX to 1. then
       you need to add »unixhierarchysep: yes« to your /etc/imapd.conf
     * Q: Why MySQL and not LDAP?
       A: Good question. LDAP is role-based and it would be indeed a
       better solution for such applications. Unfortunately LDAP is very
       hard to set up. You have to make proper schemes etc. MySQL is the
       way strait ahead, it is very easy to handle and versatile. There
       is a PAM module available for LDAP, feel free to use it.
     * Q: Why Postfix and not Qmail?
       A: Lots of people like to see such a setup with Qmail. The reason
       why is, Mysql-support is a hack and not in the included in the
       main source-tree. This could end up in a bad situation. Think if a
       security-hole is found in qmail and the patch does not work with
       the corrected version. Postfix is supporting MySQL natively.
       Another (personal) reason is that I find Postfix more sympatic (I
       don't know why)
     * Q: I got a Error: "Temporary lookup failure"
       A: Postfix cannot look up the alias table. Must common failure is
       that MySQL is not running, or there is a authentication Error.
       Check /var/log/mail and /usr/local/mysql/var/<hostname>.err to
       track the error
     * Q: Does this HOWTO also work on other platforms?
       A: Unsure. I personally compiled MySQL and Apache on AIX 4.3 and
       5.1L (php does not run properly on AIX), Solaris 6/7/8 and HP-UX.
       Cyrus, pam_mysql and cyrus I never tried. On Solaris there is
       maybe a chance to get pam_mysql running. On AIX there is no PAM,
       but a similar mechanism. In short: Try it, and let me know if were
       successful
